# Network_Visualization_of_Courses
The network visualization of the different courses of the Nicholls State University.

The information is extracted from the Nicholls State University's Website. 
Python library 'pyvis.network' and pandas are used. 
The code is more like static. The changes in the network is happening because of the changes in CSV file.
The adding of the nodes and edeges are from the CSV file.
A simple yet, powerful visualization.
